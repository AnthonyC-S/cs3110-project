   Academic Integrity Statement

   We, the people named in the @author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies.  We have adhered to those policies in
   coding this project.

   The policies do permit full collaboration among assigned author members and
   some limited collaboration among students currently enrolled in the course. 
   If any author did engage in such collaboration, here is the list of other
   students with whom we collaborated, and a brief summary of that collaboration:

   - none

   Here are any deviations from the policies that we want to document, with the
   understanding that being honest about our mistakes is more honorable than
   lying about our intellectual work:

   - none
